# HSMPCore 1.7.10
A small Forge mod that uses mixins to add various fixes/tweaks to the game. This mod was made because I was tired of having tons of small mods that only change 1 thing each.

## Configuration
Stuff can be configured under `Mod Options`, and it also includes sidebar configuration.

## Dependency
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This mod needs a Mixin bootstrap mod to work.

My recommendation is [UniMixins](https://modrinth.com/mod/unimixins). Other Mixin bootstrap mods will work too.
